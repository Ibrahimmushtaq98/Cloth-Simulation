# Cloth Simulation

This project was imported from my other repo since it was a school project. The cloth simulation uses the Runge Kutta 4th order for its explicit integrators.  However it does not have a colision system, and therefore at the end of the simulation, it will glitch out.

Futre Goals for this project

 - Have different option for different integrators
 - Implement a Colision System
 - Implement a way for the user interaction
